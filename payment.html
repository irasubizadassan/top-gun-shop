<font color="white">Online payments, especially recurring online payments, form a fundamental part of many businesses' revenue streams. However, each online payment method has distinct advantages and disadvantages. What might be well-suited to one kind of product, service, or market may be unsuitable for another.


This is critical!

Many businesses that take recurring payments undervalue the strategic significance of which online payment methods they offer their customers:

How you accept payment from your customers impacts not only your revenue but the growth of your business.

Minimising friction in your payment process saves you time and money and makes positive cash flow more likely.<p>
 Therefore, it’s important to choose payment collection methods that encourage prompt payment and can be automated as much as possible.

This guide will help you achieve more clarity on your options for taking online payments.

You will learn:

Which online payment methods are available

How they work

Frequently asked questions about online payments

How your choice of payment method affects your business

How to choose which online payment method is best for you

No single online payment method is perfect in all cases, but this guide will help you identify those that are best suited to your business.

What are online payments?
Online payments are payments that are initiated over the internet for goods or services purchased either online or offline. Common methods to facilitate this include:

Bank Debits via online mandate (often referred to as Direct Debit - which is the terminology we’ll use in this guide)

Bank transfers (also referred to as wire transfers)

Online credit or debit card transactions

Digital wallet payments (such as PayPal)

Payments can be one-off (e.g. e-commerce transactions like purchasing clothing) or
 recurring (e.g. subscriptions to services like Netflix or Spotify).<p>
